## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid

### What I learned

Improved my skills using flexbox and grid for the responsiveness of the webpage. Got much better at designing and adding small details like shadows to my cards to make the webpage look more decorated.

### Continued development

I want to continue focusing on making the webpages responsive to all screen sizes. It has been a struggle for me learning how to do so but surely getting the hang of it.
